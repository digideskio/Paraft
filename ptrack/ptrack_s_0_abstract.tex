Large-scale time-varying volume data set can take terabytes to petabytes of storage space to store and process. One promising approach is to process the data in parallel, extract features of interest, and analyze only those features, thus reducing required memory space by several orders of magnitude for the following visualization tasks. However, extracting volume features in parallel is a non-trivial task as features might span over multiple processors, and local partial features can be only visible within their own processor. In this paper, we discuss how to generate and maintain connectivity information of features across different processors. Based on this connectivity information, partial features can be integrated, which makes it possible to extract and track features for large data in parallel. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach using two data sets with up to 16384 processors.
