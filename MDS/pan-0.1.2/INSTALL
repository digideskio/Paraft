PAn follows the standard GNU installation procedure.  To compile PAn
you will need an ANSI C-compiler.  After unpacking the distribution,
rename the Makefile.[mac|unix|windows] to your suitable platform.

You can then build the library simply by typing,

  make

The libraries will be compiled into the '/lib/bin' folder.
